    "1. The LLM **generates** a candidate output. If you look at the diagram above, it happens inside the **\"Generate\"** box.\n",

       "\n",
       "1.  **Docstrings:** Your docstrings are helpful, but they could be more descriptive. Consider adding a brief explanation of how the Merge Sort algorithm works and what the functions do. This will make it easier for others to understand your code.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Type Hints:** You're using Python, which has built-in support for type hints. Consider adding type hints for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and facilitate static type checking.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Consistent Naming:** You're using both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. Python's convention is to use underscore notation (e.g., `merge_sort` instead of `mergeSort`). Stick to this convention for consistency.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Error Handling:** Your implementation doesn't handle edge cases such as non-list inputs or lists containing non-comparable elements. Consider adding input validation to handle these scenarios.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Code Organization:** The `merge` function is tightly coupled to the `merge_sort` function. Consider making `merge` a nested function inside `merge_sort` to emphasize this relationship.\n",

      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  The `merge_sort` function takes an input list and recursively divides it into two halves until each half contains only one element.\n",
      "2.  The `merge` function merges two sorted lists by comparing elements and adding the smaller one to the result list.\n",
      "3.  The sorted halves are then merged to form the final sorted list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Time Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Best-case: O(n log n)\n",
      "*   Average-case: O(n log n)\n",
      "*   Worst-case: O(n log n)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Space Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "*   O(n) for the recursive call stack and temporary arrays used in the merge process.\n",
      "\n",
      "This implementation provides a clean and efficient way to sort lists using the Merge Sort algorithm. It's suitable for large datasets and has a predictable time complexity, making it a reliable choice for various applications.\n",
      "\u001b[32m \n",
      "\n",
      "REFLECTION\n",
      "\n",
      " The provided implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Python is well-structured, readable, and efficient. However, there are some minor improvements and considerations that can be suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critiques and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Validation**: The `merge_sort` function does not validate its input. It assumes that the input will always be a list. Consider adding a check to ensure that the input is indeed a list and raise a `TypeError` if it's not.\n",
      "2. **Type Hinting**: The function parameters and return types can be annotated with type hints to improve code readability and enable static type checking.\n",
      "3. **Docstring**: While the docstring for the `merge_sort` function is good, it can be improved by adding a brief description of the Merge Sort algorithm and its time complexity.\n",
      "4. **Testing**: The example usage in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is a good start, but it's not a comprehensive test suite. Consider adding more test cases to cover different scenarios, such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers.\n",
      "5. **Error Handling**: The `merge` function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during the merge process. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that might be raised.\n",
      "6. **Code Organization**: The code is well-organized, but it might be beneficial to separate the `merge` function into its own module or file to improve reusability and modularity.\n",
      "7. **Performance**: The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for the Merge Sort algorithm. However, the space complexity can be improved by using an in-place merge approach, which would reduce the space complexity to O(log n).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the implementation is well-done, and with these minor improvements, it can become even more robust, efficient, and maintainable.\n",

       "1.  The `merge_sort` function takes an input list and recursively divides it into two halves until each half contains only one element.\n",
       "2.  The `merge` function merges two sorted lists by comparing elements and adding the smaller one to the result list.\n",
       "3.  The sorted halves are then merged to form the final sorted list.\n",

       "*   Best-case: O(n log n)\n",
